# List Project 
## Write a Real Estate program to keep track of a real estate company’s residential listings. 
### The program needs to input and keep track of all the listing information, which is currently stored using index cards that doesn’t allow for easy manipulate of the data. The real estate salespeople must be able to perform a number of tasks using this data: add or delete a house listing, view the information of a particular house given the lot number, view all the current listings and get a list of listings in a specific price range. 
Design a class object to store the house listing information. Design an ADT for the object 
storing the house listing information. Specify each ADT operation by stating its purpose, 
by describing its parameters, and the objective of the method. 
- Write the class HouseListing, using the UML diagram for guidance. 
- Write an interface for the ADT- RealEstateList, called RealEstateListInterface 
- Write the class RealEstateList that implements the interface, include all methods 
that are necessary for the function of the object and what the interface requires. 
- Write a client class that creates the RealEstateList, adding the data from the file 
LISTINGS (provided), you should also plan to add a minimum of 4 more listings 
(either to the file or when you test the adding to the list). Your client should test all 
aspects of the RealEstateList class. Using a menu should be considered in your 
design. 
- Once you have at least 10 listings in the list. You will then process the list by 
- Printing all listings using formatted output. 
- Add to the list 
- Delete from the list, given the lot number 
- Print a specific listing given the lot number 
- Get a list of all listings in a specific price range 
- You will be given the Name class and the NameInterface to use. (No changes 
can be made to these files.) You must use this class to create the Name in the 
listing. 
- Remember printing should only happen in the client class. Well written toString 
methods for all objects will aid in the output.  
- All .java files should be submitted with output from your code showing that you 
have tested all methods and completed all tasks from the list above. 
• I have provided a UML diagram to help get you started. 
• I have also provided sample output to guide in your design.
